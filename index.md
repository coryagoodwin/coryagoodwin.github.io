## Reflections on FOSS

### 1-22-2020 [pending]

I'm not sure if I'm only supposed to talk about The Cathedral and the Bazaar in this post, but I figured I'd blog about my team experience throughout the week as well. Progress with my team has been going very well. I'd worked with two of the members before in previous classes (and in the case of one, work environments) so we're getting along well and tossing ideas along nicely. I'd originally suggested that we go with Osu!, as it looked like a lot of fun and that there was plenty to do. Unfortunately, after trying to get in contact with them on their official Discord Server, nobody had replied after two attempts (following their rules), so I figured with that sort of response we wouldn't be able to get much done in the way of communication, and went with Mozilla instead. We're currently tossing around ideas for add-ons to make, and alternatively we can contribute to their addons-frontend repository.

Now, on the topic of The Cathedral and the Bazaar, [wip, still reading]



## Introduction

### 1-12-2020

I will be blogging in this format on this page for the entire semester, adding new posts on top of this one in the same format. I believe this is the simplest way to do it while looking professional. I've utilized the Pages function of Github with the Midnight theme created by user 'mattgraham'. I followed these steps to set this site up, and they have been very useful: <a href='https://guides.github.com/features/pages/'>https://guides.github.com/features/pages/</a>

To introduce myself, I am Cory Goodwin. I will be graduating this semester, and I'm hoping to leave this class with an appreciable experience in programming. While I don't see myself pursuing software development as a full-time career, it will be good to dabble in it a bit. I wasn't supposed to take this course as a Computer Information Systems major, but due to issues outside of my control, all I can do is make the best of it. そして日本語を勉強中だから、日本の会社や日本にもいる会社に働けばいいだろうと思っています。 (Also, because I'm studying Japanese, I think I should work for a Japanese company, or a company that is also in Japan.) Those are the most important facts about me and I am both excited and stressed about the coming semester. I will be devoting a lot of energy to this course, and I hope that all of that energy provides opportunities to shine. One of my career goals is to be versatile so that I can work flexibly in my own time, so this class should prepare me for that if some software-engineering-focused needs were to arise in any position I find myself in.
